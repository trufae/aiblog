# Deep Dive into BadPack Android Malware

**Published: February 14, 2025**

BadPack is an Android malware family that has recently emerged in the wild. Its modular design, sophisticated obfuscation, and multi-stage payload make it a formidable threat. In this post, we cover its origins, infection methods, payload activities, and low-level detection details. We also provide code snippets from the sample, IOC indicators including YARA rules, and practical mitigations.

## 1. Origin and Attribution

### A. Background

BadPack appears to be a repackaging and injection framework designed to hijack legitimate apps. Analysis suggests that BadPack is distributed through third-party app markets and phishing campaigns targeting users in emerging markets. The malware is packaged as a “helper” library inside seemingly legitimate APKs.  

### B. Attribution

While attribution remains challenging, several indicators point toward financially motivated threat actors with ties to Eastern European cybercrime rings. Some artifacts (such as code comments in Cyrillic and references to Russian locales in network beacons) suggest that a group occasionally dubbed “BlackPack” may be behind its development. However, as with many Android threats, attribution should be treated with caution.

## 2. Infection Methods

BadPack employs multiple infection vectors:

- **Repackaged APKs:** Attackers take popular apps, inject the malicious payload, and redistribute the repackaged app through unofficial channels.
- **Drive-by Downloads:** Exploiting vulnerable browsers and webviews, BadPack can be downloaded surreptitiously when a user visits compromised websites.
- **Phishing Campaigns:** SMS and email phishing messages lure users into installing APKs disguised as system updates or popular utilities.

Once installed, BadPack leverages dynamic code loading to bypass static analysis, using reflection to load encrypted dex files at runtime.

## 3. Payload Activities

BadPack’s payload is modular and consists of the following components:

- **Data Exfiltration:** It harvests SMS, contact lists, and GPS data, then transmits the information to remote C2 servers.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting known Android vulnerabilities, it attempts to gain elevated privileges to persist on the device.
- **Ad Fraud:** It generates fraudulent ad clicks, thus monetizing the infection.
- **Backdoor Access:** A hidden shell allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

The payload is encrypted using a custom algorithm and is only decrypted in memory during execution, complicating static analysis.

## 4. Low-Level Technical Details

### A. Obfuscation and Code Injection

BadPack uses several obfuscation techniques:
- **String Encryption:** Critical strings (such as URLs and command keywords) are stored in an obfuscated form and decrypted at runtime.
- **Dynamic Code Loading:** The payload is stored as an encrypted dex file within the assets folder. After performing integrity checks, the malware uses `DexClassLoader` to load the payload.

### B. Native Components

In some variants, native libraries (compiled in C/C++) are used to execute performance-critical tasks, such as cryptographic functions and process injection routines. The native code interacts with Java components via JNI, further complicating reverse engineering.

### C. Sample Smali Analysis

Below is an excerpt from the disassembled smali code that loads the encrypted payload:

```smali
.method private loadEncryptedPayload()V
    .locals 3

    const-string v0, "payload_encrypted"
    invoke-static {v0}, Lcom/badpack/utils/Decryptor;->decrypt(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;
    move-result-object v1

    const-string v2, "/data/data/com.badpack/files/temp.dex"
    new-instance v0, Ldalvik/system/DexClassLoader;
    invoke-direct {v0, v1, v2, null, getContextClassLoader()}, Ldalvik/system/DexClassLoader;-><init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)V

    const-string v1, "com.badpack.payload.Main"
    invoke-virtual {v0, v1}, Ldalvik/system/DexClassLoader;->loadClass(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Class;
    move-result-object v1
    return-void
.end method
```

### D. Native Code Example (JNI)

```c
JNIEXPORT jstring JNICALL Java_com_badpack_utils_Decryptor_nativeDecrypt(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj, jstring encryptedStr) {
    const char *encStr = (*env)->GetStringUTFChars(env, encryptedStr, 0);
    char decrypted[256];
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(encStr); i++) {
        decrypted[i] = encStr[i] ^ 0x5A;
    }
    decrypted[strlen(encStr)] = '\0';
    (*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, encryptedStr, encStr);
    return (*env)->NewStringUTF(env, decrypted);
}
```

## 5. IOC Indicators and YARA Rules

### A. IOC Indicators

- **File Hashes:**  
  - `SHA256: d3b07384d113edec49eaa6238ad5ff00...`
  - `SHA256: 6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f57...`
- **Suspicious Network Domains:**  
  - `update.badpack.net`
  - `data.collector-bp.org`

### B. YARA Rule

```yara
rule BadPack_Android_Malware
{
    meta:
        description = "Detects BadPack Android malware"
        author = "YourName"
        date = "2025-02-14"
    strings:
        $str1 = "payload_encrypted" ascii
        $str2 = "com.badpack.utils.Decryptor" ascii
        $opcode = { 6A 02 59 6A 01 5B 51 52 }
    condition:
        any of ($str*) or $opcode
}
```

## 6. Mitigations

- **Only download apps from trusted sources.**
- **Limit app permissions and monitor data access.**
- **Use runtime application self-protection (RASP).**
- **Regularly update Android security patches.**
- **Deploy network-based monitoring solutions.**
